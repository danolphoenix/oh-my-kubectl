# oh-my-kubectl
simple tool to generate visualized result of kubectl

every time when i want to see the label and the taint info， node usage statistics， i have to type "kubectl get xxxx" for many times to collect result data then paste it into excel and analyse them

hope i can write a simple tool to do this ai statistic work.
